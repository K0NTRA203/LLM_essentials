The choice of library depends on the specific requirements of your project, but in general, they work by providing a way to define and manage GraphQL queries and mutations, and automatically handling things like caching, pagination, and error handling.\n\nApollo Client is a popular library for working with GraphQL in React. It provides a set of React hooks that you can use to manage your application's state and handle data loading, caching, and error handling. You can use the `useQuery` hook to run a query and fetch data, and the `useMutation` hook to run a mutation and update data. These hooks return the query results and update function, respectively, that you can use in your components.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use these hooks in a React component to fetch data from a GraphQL API and display it in a table:\n```js\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nconst GET_AGENTS = gql`\n  query agents {\n    agents {\n      id\n      name\n      email\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nfunction AgentTable() {\n  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_AGENTS);\n\n  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;\n  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>ID</th>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Email</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        {data.agents.map((agent) => (\n          <tr key={agent.id}>\n            <td>{agent.id}</td>\n            <td>{agent.name}</td>\n            <td>{agent.email}</td>\n          </tr>\n        ))}\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo handle the state management, you can use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React.\n```js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction AgentTable() {\n  const [agents, setAgents] = useState([]);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const { loading,"]},"end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"7c631b6b-699f-49e1-979e-a7e977ba6fb8","children":["845c6d25-d747-4ae3-9ea0-d37d19c9f599"]},"845c6d25-d747-4ae3-9ea0-d37d19c9f599":{"id":"845c6d25-d747-4ae3-9ea0-d37d19c9f599","message":{"id":"845c6d25-d747-4ae3-9ea0-d37d19c9f599","role":"user","user":null,"create_time":1673438224.806781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I used apollo what is your suggestion for directory structure of graphql api handling for all types of users?"]},"end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"92093430-3d63-4e2d-b92c-c9cda4d9b61f","children":["c89bee11-c1a3-4dce-96c7-133e7855b53a"]},"c89bee11-c1a3-4dce-96c7-133e7855b53a":{"id":"c89bee11-c1a3-4dce-96c7-133e7855b53a","message":{"id":"c89bee11-c1a3-4dce-96c7-133e7855b53a","role":"assistant","user":null,"create_time":1673438299.377677,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's an example of how you might structure the directory for handling GraphQL queries for state management in your application:\n```\nsrc/\n├── graphql/\n│   ├── client.js              # apollo client setup\n│   ├── resolvers/             # custom resolvers \n│   │   ├── userResolvers.js  \n│   │   ├── agentResolvers.js\n│   ├── queries/              # graphql queries\n│   │   ├── userQueries.js   \n│   │   ├── agentQueries.js\n│   ├── mutations/             # graphql mutations\n│   │   ├── userMutations.js   \n│   │   ├── agentMutations.js\n│   ├── schema.js             # schema definition\n│   └── types/                 # graphql types\n│       ├── userTypes.js   \n│       ├── agentTypes.js\n├── components/\n│   ├── User/\n│   │   ├── UserList.js\n│   │   ├── UserDetails.js\n│   ├── Agent/\n│   │   ├── AgentList.js\n│   │   ├── AgentDetails.js\n└── store/\n    ├── actions/\n    │   ├── userActions.js\n    │   ├── agentActions.js\n    ├── reducers/\n    │   ├── userReducer.js\n    │   ├── agentReducer.js\n    └── types.js\n```\n\nThis directory structure separates the different types of users in a clear way.

You can use Formik to handle the form state and validation, and your custom TextField and Select components to render the form fields. You should also use your custom Button component to render the form's submit and cancel buttons.\n\n- ManagerTable.js:\nThis file should contain a table that displays the list of managers, using your `managerData` JSON. You can use Material-UI's Table component to render the table, and your custom Button component to render the actions (edit, delete) for each manager.\n\n- ManagerPage.js:\nThis file should contain the layout and the overall logic of the manager page. It should contain the ManagerForm and ManagerTable components, and handle the communication between them. For example, when a manager is created/updated/deleted in the ManagerForm, it should update the ManagerTable to reflect the changes.\n\n- Manager.js:\nThis file should be the entry point of the manager page. It should contain the Provider component, import all the styles and render the ManagerPage component.\n\nYou need to import the `useFormikContext` to use the formik context inside your component.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level overview and there are many details that you will need to implement in order to make the CRUD functionality work properly.\n"]},"end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|im_end|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"87cad01d-2faa-4164-9491-b3e357eb3340","children":["f71232ac-66ea-453b-ab3a-463b959c6a1c"]},"f71232ac-66ea-453b-ab3a-463b959c6a1c":{"id":"f71232ac-66ea-453b-ab3a-463b959c6a1c","message":{"id":"f71232ac-66ea-453b-ab3a-463b959c6a1c","role":"user","user":null,"create_time":1673504467.588183,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Write ManagerForm file. just write code and don't describe more."]},"end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"e775c3fb-906a-4d6f-b83c-d4185fe2b37a","children":["21e2d826-ae63-4ee8-a074-66054780c7ff"]},"21e2d826-ae63-4ee8-a074-66054780c7ff":{"id":"21e2d826-ae63-4ee8-a074-66054780c7ff","message":{"id":"21e2d826-ae63-4ee8-a074-66054780c7ff","role":"assistant","user":null,"create_time":1673504549.914641,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Formik, Form, Field } from 'formik';\nimport TextField from 'atoms/TextField';\nimport Select from 'atoms/Select';\nimport Button from 'atoms/Button';\nimport * as Yup from \"yup\";\nimport managerData from './managerData';\n\nconst ManagerForm = ({initialValues, onSubmit, isEditMode = false}) => {\n    const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({\n        firstName: Yup.string().required(\"First name is required\"),\n        lastName: Yup.string().required(\"Last name is required\"),\n        username: Yup.string().required(\"Username is required\"),\n        email: Yup.string().email(\"Invalid email\").required(\"Email is required\"),\n        mobile: Yup.string().required(\"Mobile is required\"),\n        addr: Yup.string().required(\"Address is required\"),\n        password: Yup.string().when('isEditMode', {\n            is: false,\n            then: Yup.string().required(\"Password is required\").min(5, \"Your password is too short.\"),\n            otherwise: Yup.string()\n        }),\n        confirmPassword: Yup.string().when('isEditMode', {\n            is: false,\n            then: Yup.string().oneOf([Yup.ref(\"password\"), null], \"Passwords must match\"),\n            otherwise: Yup.string()\n        }),\n        avatar: Yup.mixed().when('isEditMode', {\n            is: false,\n            then: Yup.mixed().required(\"Profile Image is required\"),\n            otherwise: Yup.mixed()\n        }),\n    });\n\n    return (\n        <Formik\n            enableReinitialize={true}\n            initialValues={initialValues}\n            validationSchema={validationSchema}\n            onSubmit={onSubmit}\n        >\n            {({ isSubmitting, errors, touched, setFieldValue }) => (\n                <Form>\n                    {managerData.fields.map((fieldsRow, index) => (\n                        <div className=\"form-row\" key={index}>\n                            {fieldsRow.map((field) => (\n                                <div className=\"form-group col-md-6\" key={field.name}>\n                                    {field.type === \"hidden\" ?

you are getting an error that says \"Do not use Array index in keys,\" it means that you are using the index of an element in an array as the key for that element when rendering a list of items in React. In general, it is considered an anti-pattern to use the index of an array as the key for an element in a list, because it can lead to unexpected behavior when the list updates. \n\nInstead, you should use a unique identifier for each item in the list as the key. If your data does not have a unique identifier, you can use the index as a last resort but it's not recommended.\n\nHere is an example of how you can change the code to avoid using the index as the key:\n```\n{managerModule.fields.map((fieldsRow, rowIndex) => (\n  <div key={fieldsRow.id} className={styles.row}>\n    {fieldsRow.map((field, index) => {\n      if (field.type === \"hidden\") {\n        return (\n          <input\n            key={field.id}\n            type={field.type}\n            name={field.name}\n            value={values[field.name]}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            onBlur={handleBlur}\n            className={styles.hidden}\n          />\n        );\n      }\n      if (field.type === \"select\") {\n        return (\n          <Select\n            key={field.id}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            onBlur={handleBlur}\n            value={values[field.name]}\n            name={field.name}\n            id={field.id}\n            label={field.label}\n            options={field.options}\n            error={Boolean(errors[field.name])}\n            helperText={errors[field.name]}\n          />\n        );\n      }\n      return (\n        <div key={field.id} className={styles.column}>\n          <TextField\n           "]},"end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"afe7fb1e-e482-438b-a939-eccc21dea767","children":["df2778bb-d670-47e1-b55b-54402d205798"]},"df2778bb-d670-47e1-b55b-54402d205798":{"id":"df2778bb-d670-47e1-b55b-54402d205798","message":{"id":"df2778bb-d670-47e1-b55b-54402d205798","role":"user","user":null,"create_time":1673678201.670533,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["write ManagerForm/index.js"]},"end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"3b36baa8-5b97-49c1-a1c6-1eb64f86097a","children":["8a339d67-e784-483f-9404-4a4675c2c7d2"]},"8a339d67-e784-483f-9404-4a4675c2c7d2":{"id":"8a339d67-e784-483f-9404-4a4675c2c7d2","message":{"id":"8a339d67-e784-483f-9404-4a4675c2c7d2","role":"assistant","user":null,"create_time":1673678210.924724,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["```\nimport ManagerForm from \"./ManagerForm\";\nexport default ManagerForm;\n```\n\nNote that in this file, you are simply re-exporting the default export of the `ManagerForm` file, so that it can be imported more easily in other parts of your application using the `import ManagerForm from \"organisms/Manager/ManagerForm\"` syntax.\n"]},"end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|im_end|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"df2778bb-d670-47e1-b55b-54402d205798","children":["d3d064dd-1026-4639-ad22-b840fdc3ba8e"]},"d3d064dd-1026-4639-ad22-b840fdc3ba8e":{"id":"d3d064dd-1026-4639-ad22-b840fdc3ba8e","message":{"id":"d3d064dd-1026-4639-ad22-b840fdc3ba8e","role":"user","user":null,"create_time":1673678283.979027,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["write ManagerForm/styes.scss"]},"end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"8a339d67-e784-483f-9404-4a4675c2c7d2","children":["89cc433f-3a3c-4e0c-889f-e41e318faacb"]},"89cc433f-3a3c-4e0c-889f-e41e318faacb":{"id":"89cc433f-3a3c-4e0c-889f-e41e318faacb","message":{"id":"89cc433f-3a3c-4e0c-889f-e41e318faacb","role":"assistant","user":null,"create_time":1673678306.088676,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["It's impossible to write the entire content of `ManagerForm/styles.scss` without knowing the context of the project.

After that you need to create a client instance and wrap your root component with the `ApolloProvider` component.\n\nOnce you have set up Apollo, you can use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks to execute GraphQL queries and mutations in your components.\n\nYou can also use `Query` and `Mutation` components to execute GraphQL operations, and use the `graphql` higher-order component to create a new component that is connected to your GraphQL data.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information on how to use Apollo GraphQL in your application.\n"]},"end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|im_end|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"403fd3e4-aef4-43ef-8fba-7bd99858d3bc","children":["2769b4fa-ba6b-413c-80a9-d5e50acfe553"]},"2769b4fa-ba6b-413c-80a9-d5e50acfe553":{"id":"2769b4fa-ba6b-413c-80a9-d5e50acfe553","message":{"id":"2769b4fa-ba6b-413c-80a9-d5e50acfe553","role":"user","user":null,"create_time":1673856015.989691,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["in this code:\nvalue={field.value === undefined ? props.defaultValue : field.value}\nI want to use from apollo graphql and maybe redux "]},"end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"b4fdd24e-560e-4a16-8db4-1a04fce81cc6","children":["dfe35fdf-9b58-4b09-918a-a72dc5961203"]},"dfe35fdf-9b58-4b09-918a-a72dc5961203":{"id":"dfe35fdf-9b58-4b09-918a-a72dc5961203","message":{"id":"dfe35fdf-9b58-4b09-918a-a72dc5961203","role":"assistant","user":null,"create_time":1673856054.392327,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You can access the value from Apollo GraphQL by using the `useQuery` hook to fetch the data and then using the `data` object to access the specific value you need.
